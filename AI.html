The ideal political system could be created. In the future, in order to preserve the rest of Earth, the AI might put us all in simulations of our best dreams living in happiness forever, underground somewhere, while our bodies grow old and eventually die, which would honestly not be a bad life at all.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reducing human errors is already happening with autocorrect and tools like Grammarly, but eventually, it&rsquo;s going to be taken to the next level.
